# NP-Complete-Project

David Nguyen will do the exact solution part.
Christopher Simmons will do the approximation part.

Problem description:
    Given an undirected graph, find the minimum color needed to label each node such that there are no adjacent labels of the same color.

Problem input format:
    - The first line tells you how many vertices are in the graph G. The lines that follow contain the edge list for edge vertex.
